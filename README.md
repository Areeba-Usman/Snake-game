GitHub README ke liye description thoda structured hona chahiye taaki agar koi aapka code dekhe, toh use samajh aa jaye ki ye project kya hai aur kaise kaam karta hai.

Yahan ek clean aur professional README description hai:

🐉 Interactive Dragon Animation
A lightweight, high-performance generative animation built using Vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. This project features a fluid, particle-based "dragon" or "snake" trail that follows user interaction with smooth physics and dynamic gradients.

✨ Features
Smooth Particle Physics: Uses distance and easing calculations for a natural movement feel.

Interactive Motion: The animation reacts to both mousemove and touch events.

Dynamic Visuals: Features a glowing gradient trail and a background grid of reactive dots.

Fully Responsive: Automatically adjusts to different screen sizes and orientations.

🚀 Tech Stack
HTML5: Canvas API for rendering.

CSS3: Basic styling and layout.

JavaScript: Pure ES6+ logic (No external libraries like Three.js or P5.js).
